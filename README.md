🌿 Project Description: Plant Disease Detection using CNN
This project aims to develop an automated system that can detect plant diseases by analyzing images of leaves using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The dataset consists of over 87,000 RGB images of healthy and diseased leaves categorized into 38 different classes. The images are divided into training (80%), validation (20%), and a separate test set for prediction.

The main goal of the project is to help farmers and agricultural workers identify plant diseases early so that they can take immediate action and avoid crop loss. CNN is used in this project because it is highly effective in image classification tasks, as it can learn complex patterns and features from the images automatically.

🚀 Project Workflow
Image Preprocessing: Resizing, normalization, and augmentation
