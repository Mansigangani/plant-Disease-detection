# plant-Disease-detection
This project aims to develop an automated system that can detect plant diseases by analyzing images of leaves using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The main goal of the project is to help farmers and agricultural workers identify plant diseases early so that they can take immediate action and avoid crop loss.
